# Task Lifecycle Workflow

Follow this workflow when starting a new task from a GitHub issue.

## 1. Issue Analysis
- Read the specified issue using the GitHub CLI: `gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER>`
- Understand the requirements and context.

## 2. Branch Creation
- Ensure you are on the latest `main` branch: `git checkout main && git pull`
- Create a new branch with a suitable name based on the issue:
  - Format: `type/description-of-change` (e.g., `feature/add-new-analyzer`, `fix/broken-test`)
  - Reference `.cursor/rules/git.mdc` for branch naming conventions.

## 3. Planning
- Create a detailed implementation plan for the task.
- Break down the work into logical steps.

## 4. Implementation Loop
Iterate through the plan, implementing one logical change at a time.

For each step:
1.  **Implement**: Write the code.
2.  **Verify**: Ensure the changes pass all checks.
    - Run `make check` (runs lint, format-check, and mypy).
    - Run `make test` (runs pytest).
    - Fix any errors before committing.
3.  **Commit**: Create a commit for the change.
    - Follow the commit message rules in `.cursor/rules/git.mdc`.

## 5. Final Verification & PR
- Verify that the entire task is solved and acceptance criteria are met.
- Create a Pull Request using `gh`:
  - `gh pr create`
  - Fill in the title and description (referencing the issue, e.g., "Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>").
